Day 1/30: Java Programming Challenge

After completing C and C++, I'm excited to dive into Java, starting with the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Today, I focused on two key areas:

ðŸ”¹ OOP Principles: Java's OOP model provides a structured approach to programming. I explored core concepts such as:

Encapsulation: Restricting access to certain details within objects and exposing only what's necessary.
Inheritance: Leveraging existing code by creating new classes that inherit from parent classes.
Polymorphism: Allowing methods to perform different tasks based on the object invoking them.
ðŸ”¹ Data Types and Variables: Java's strong typing system allows for efficient memory usage and helps in error detection. I reviewed primitive data types (e.g., int, float, boolean) and how they enable precise control over data.

Iâ€™m committed to broadening my skills each day and applying these foundational concepts to larger projects. Stay tuned for more updates!
